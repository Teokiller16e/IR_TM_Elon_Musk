neutral,"Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? "
neutral, You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
neutral, What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
neutral, Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
neutral, I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
neutral, I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
neutral,Can you do push-ups ? 
neutral," Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . "
neutral, You mean 30 push-ups ? 
neutral, Yeah ! 
neutral," It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . "
neutral,Can you study with the radio on ? 
neutral," No , I listen to background music . "
neutral, What is the difference ? 
neutral, The radio has too many comerials . 
neutral," That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . "
neutral,Are you all right ? 
neutral, I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . 
neutral, I see . 
neutral,"Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? "
neutral," Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . "
neutral, What position do you play ? 
neutral, I ' m a defender . It ' s a lot of fun . You don ' t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
neutral," Yeah , you ' re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . "
neutral, The Rockets . 
neutral," All right , see you later . "
neutral,"Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? "
neutral, What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 
neutral," It ' s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ' m an Aries . When were you born ? "
neutral, January 5th . 
neutral," That ' s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . "
neutral," No , it ' s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . "
neutral," Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ' re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? "
neutral,"Frank ' s getting married , do you believe this ? "
neutral," Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . "
neutral, Who is he marring ? 
neutral," A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . "
neutral, Have they set a date for the wedding ? 
neutral, Not yet . 
neutral,I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . 
neutral," That ' s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . "
neutral, What kind of house is it ? 
neutral," No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ' s a two-car garage . "
neutral," Yeas , when will you buy a house ? "
neutral," Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . "
neutral,"Hi , Becky , what's up ? "
neutral," Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . "
neutral, What's the problem ? 
neutral, She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . 
neutral, For example ? 
neutral," Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . "
neutral," No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . "
neutral, It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . 
neutral," My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . "
neutral, You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? 
neutral," We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . "
neutral,How are Zina's new programmers working out ? 
neutral," I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . "
neutral," So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? "
neutral," It'll be close , but we'll make it . "
neutral," Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . "
neutral," And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . "
neutral,Do you like cooking ? 
neutral, Why do you like it ? 
neutral, I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . 
neutral," And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . "
neutral, Certainly . 
neutral,Anyone home ? Jen ! 
neutral, I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in !

neutral, How was it ? 
neutral, Like what ? 
neutral," I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . "
neutral, I ' m so jealous . 
neutral,"Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? "
neutral," It ' s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ' t wear perfume . "
neutral, I ' m sorry . I didn ' t know that . 
neutral,"Ah , ah , ah ... "
neutral," All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast . "
neutral, Jog ? 
neutral," Then , you are to walk to work . "
neutral, Walk ?

neutral," OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class . "
neutral, Dance class ! I don't know how . 
neutral, You will . 
neutral, Oh ... 
neutral,"Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . "
neutral, Oh where was that ? 
neutral, I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
neutral, Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
neutral," Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? "
neutral, She will be 86 next month . 
neutral,I would like to register for a class today . 
neutral," No problem , what class would you like to take ? "
neutral, I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy .

neutral, The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three .

neutral,"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . "
neutral," Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . "
neutral, To me English is a difficult language . 
neutral, A second language is always difficult . 
neutral," True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . "
neutral, One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
neutral, No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
neutral,Can I help you ? 
neutral," I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . "
neutral, I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?

neutral,Here ' s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 
neutral," Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . "
neutral, What ' s the score ?

neutral," Sorry , I don't smoke . "
neutral,Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ? 
neutral, This one .

neutral," No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button . "
neutral,Every country should face the history . 
neutral," Yeah , we don ' t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . "
neutral," Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . "
neutral, But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . 
neutral," I believe such things won ' t be realized , just daydreaming . "
neutral,"Do you like traveling , Kathy ? "
neutral," I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ' t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... "
neutral, Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ' re driving .

neutral,Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . 
neutral, I do wish I could afford one .

neutral, So are you ! How about another coffee ? 
neutral,What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
neutral, I like playing chess . 
neutral, Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ? 
neutral, I'm afraid not . 
neutral, Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ? 
neutral," Oh , yes . I like playing basketball . "
neutral, Can you tell me why you like it ? 
neutral, Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . 
neutral,Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere .

neutral,You honestly believe the world ' s improving every year ? 
neutral," Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? "
neutral, I don ' t think you ' re right there . 
neutral, I believe industry is making us wealthier . 
neutral, I don ' t believe that . 
neutral," And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . "
neutral," I agree with you in the sense . But we ' re all more miserable than ever , aren ' t we ? "
neutral," I don ' t agree with you . I maintain that we ' re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . "
neutral, That ' s your opinion not mine . 
neutral,What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
neutral," I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . "
neutral,How may I help you ? 
neutral, I would like to return this book . 
neutral, Is that all you need ? 
neutral, I also want to check out this video . 
neutral, Is that all you would like to check out ? 
neutral, That ' s all I need . 
neutral, Do you have your library card ? 
neutral, Here it is . 
neutral, Make sure to take proper care of this video . 
neutral, That won ' t be a problem . 
neutral," If you damage the video , you will be fined . "
neutral, I won ' t damage it . 
neutral,What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . 
neutral, It's us . 
neutral, What do you mean by us . 
neutral," Well , you always say you're busy . "
neutral, That's right . 
neutral, And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . 
neutral," I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . "
neutral," Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . "
neutral, You mean I am groaned a few words ? 
neutral, Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
neutral,"Hi , Mary . You look pale today . What's the matter with you ? "
neutral, I think I've caught a cold . Now I'm aching all over . 
neutral, You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest . I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon . 
neutral, Thank you . I suppose I should go to see a doctor . 
neutral,"Could you tell me the right time , please ? "
neutral, Well . My watch says five past two . But it ' s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days . 
neutral, You have to go and fix it . 
neutral, Yes . I will . 
neutral,does your family have a record of your ancestors ? 
neutral, sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ' s always updating it . 
neutral, do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ' d love to see it . 
neutral," I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . "
neutral, that ' s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? 
neutral, I ' Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ' s side and 10 cousins on my dad ' s side . 
neutral, are you very close to your first-cousins ? 
neutral," the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ' m older , I don ' t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ' t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . "
neutral, I see . who ' s the head of your household ? 
neutral," it ' s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . "
neutral, that ' s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? 
neutral," at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ' Ve been married for a few years , she ' s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . "
neutral," that ' s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . "
neutral,I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? 
neutral, Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? 
neutral, Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . 
neutral, Could you move smoothly ? 
neutral, Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . 
neutral, What happened afterwards ? 
neutral, I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . 
neutral, Poor girl ! 
neutral,"Hey , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? "
neutral," About David ? No , I didn ' t hear anything . "
neutral," You know , about David and his new boss . "
neutral," Sorry , I don ' t quite follow you . "
neutral," Well , I heard David has been fired . "
neutral," Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . "
neutral,how do you usually get to school ? 
neutral, I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
neutral," I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . "
neutral, I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! 
neutral," I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . "
neutral," cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . "
neutral, do you have a car ? 
neutral," no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . "
neutral," maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . "
neutral, you could try . It would save you a lot of money . 
neutral," that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . "
neutral," if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! "
neutral, I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! 
neutral, let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . 
neutral, sounds good ! Let's go ! 
neutral,What's wrong with him ? 
neutral, His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . 
neutral,"What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? "
neutral," Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . "
neutral, You are going to take courses ? 
neutral, Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
neutral, Sounds hard . 
neutral," Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . "
neutral, Won ' t you get lonely ? 
neutral," Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . "
neutral," Well , do you think I have to ? "
neutral, I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . 
neutral, Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
neutral, But I don't think it's so nice . 
neutral, Why ? 
neutral, The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . 
neutral," Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . "
neutral,"On , darn . The grocery store is closed . "
neutral," Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . "
neutral, Alright . We are out of everything . 
neutral, I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . 
neutral," I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ' s open when we get home . "
neutral," Yeah , and the prices there are very high . "
neutral, I know . Three dollars for milk . 
neutral,Do you think they two will get married ? 
neutral, You can count on it . 
neutral," I think so.Yes , they get along so well . "
neutral,"Dad , where are we off to ? "
neutral, First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . 
neutral, Where are we going to have a drink ? 
neutral, There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 
neutral, Yes ? 
neutral, That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . 
neutral, Good . I will have hot chocolate . 
neutral, A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . 
neutral, When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . 
neutral, Sorry . How far is the museum ? 
neutral, I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . 
neutral, Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . 
neutral," I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . "
neutral, Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . 
neutral, Don't you think it's too bloody ? 
neutral," On the contrary , very exciting . "
neutral,I feel so uncomfortable . 
neutral, Are you sick ? 
neutral, No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . 
neutral, He ' ll finish writing in a minute . 
neutral,I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . 
neutral, Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
neutral," Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! "
neutral, Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
neutral," Oh , I didn ' t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . "
neutral," I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . "
neutral, Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 
neutral,"Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? "
neutral, It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
neutral," Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? "
neutral," News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . "
neutral, Is there anything interesting ? 
neutral," Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . "
neutral, I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? 
neutral, Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
neutral, That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 
neutral, Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . 
neutral, I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? 
neutral," Yes , 50 Yuan per month . "
neutral, Look at the view from the window . 
neutral, It can ' t be helped . 
neutral,"What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? "
neutral," Well , I like playing the violin . "
neutral, Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? 
neutral, About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . 
neutral,How can I tell her about this ? 
neutral," Don't worry , you'll find a way . "
neutral, There is no need to be so frustrated . 
neutral, How can you live without job in the future ? 
neutral," Don't worry , you'll find a way . "
neutral,What sports do you like to play ? 
neutral, I like baseball and basketball . 
neutral, How about football ? 
neutral," In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . "
neutral, It's a very popular game in America . 
neutral, Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? 
neutral," For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . "
neutral, Are you a football player ? 
neutral," No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . "
neutral, What is two hand touch and flag football ? 
neutral," Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . "
neutral, I see . It's safer then right ? 
neutral,What upsets you ? 
neutral, It is not your mother finding one for you ? 
neutral," I will find one myself , of course . I ' m a modern girl . "
neutral," Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . "
neutral," No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . "
neutral, I don ' t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . 
neutral," I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . "
neutral," Don ' t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . "
neutral,Are you going to the party on Saturday ? 
neutral, I was thinking about it . Are you ? 
neutral, It starts at 8 
neutral," Well , who all is going to be there ? "
neutral, Everyone from school . 
neutral, How do you know it's going to be so fun ? 
neutral,Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? 
neutral, Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? 
neutral, Am I failing ? 
neutral, Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? 
neutral," I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? "
neutral, I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . 
neutral," Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? "
neutral, I'll try ; it's hard ! 
neutral, Thanks for stopping by ! 
neutral, What happened ? Quarrel again ? 
neutral, Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . 
neutral, What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
neutral, And ? 
neutral, So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
neutral, And it's a brick ? 
neutral, Yes . 
neutral," I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . "
neutral, So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
neutral," Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . "
neutral, But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
neutral, He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
neutral," Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! "
neutral," C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . "
neutral, That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
neutral," You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "
neutral,Is the clock right ? 
neutral, I'm afraid it gains a little . 
neutral, By how many minutes ? 
neutral, Two . 
neutral,"Hey , Mary , what's up ? "
neutral," Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . "
neutral," Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . "
neutral," There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . "
neutral, I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
neutral," Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . "
neutral,What ' s up ? You don ' t look too good . 
neutral," I liked physics . It ' s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . "
neutral," Yeah , yeah , but today ' s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . "
neutral, A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ' s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
neutral, It ' s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ' s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
neutral," Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ' s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ' s what the math says . "
neutral," Math , sheath . What ' s the evidence ? "
neutral," There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ' s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! "
neutral," Anyway , it ' s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ' s the scientific rigor in that ? "
neutral," Dude , don ' t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ' t you ? "
neutral,Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? 
neutral, I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning 
neutral, Does that mean studying all the time ? 
neutral," I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . "
neutral, Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . 
neutral, You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts 
neutral," Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . "
neutral," Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . "
neutral, You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . 
neutral," Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . "
neutral,How old are you ? 
neutral, Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? 
neutral, I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . 
neutral, Are you going to have a birthday party ? 
neutral, Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
neutral, Hi honey ! What ' s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 
neutral, No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ' t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! 
neutral," I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ' t have the willpower to just quit . I can ' t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? "
neutral,Why are you shivering ? 
neutral, It's freezing . 
neutral,It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . 
neutral, How come you think of him that way ? 
neutral, I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . 
neutral, Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . 
neutral,Have you signed up to join the company ' s Christmas party ? 
neutral," Sure , I have . Will you join ? "
neutral," I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . "
neutral, You are right . Our company ' s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
neutral, I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
neutral," No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . "
neutral," Don ' t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . "
neutral,"If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . "
neutral, I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . 
neutral,"hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? "
neutral," The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . "
neutral, He is cute.What dose he do ? 
neutral," I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . "
neutral," Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . "
neutral,You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . 
neutral, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
neutral, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
neutral, Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
neutral,"Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? "
neutral," Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . "
neutral," Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . "
neutral," And I bet you studied , too . "
neutral, Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? 
neutral," Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . "
neutral, Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! 
neutral,There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . 
neutral, What's the route ? 
neutral, From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . 
neutral, If only I could join it ! 
neutral,Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . 
neutral, You must have realized somebody was here . 
neutral," Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . "
neutral,What ' s the life expectancy in your country ? 
neutral," I ' m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? "
neutral," About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ' s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . "
neutral," I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . "
neutral, Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
neutral, How ' s your son these days ? 
neutral," Oh , he ' s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . "
neutral, He ' ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? 
neutral," I had mine when I was 24 . that ' s a little young . I ' d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . "
neutral," Yes , I think you ' re right . I ' m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . "
neutral, Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 
neutral," Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ' t often succeed . "
neutral, Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 
neutral," It ' s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . "
neutral,Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
neutral," Yes , I ' m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? "
neutral, Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
neutral, Which room are you in ? 
neutral," 1808 . The toilet doesn ' t work properly , the water doesn ' t run in the shower . "
neutral, I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away . 
neutral, Not only that ! 
neutral, Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! 
neutral," OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! "
neutral,We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . 
neutral, I'm very sorry I can't . 
neutral, Why not ? 
neutral, I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . 
neutral,"You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? "
neutral," Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . "
neutral," I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . "
neutral," I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! "
neutral," You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . "
neutral," That's right , I have to work hard . "
neutral,The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? 
neutral," Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? "
neutral, Certainly . 
neutral,"Excuse me , is this seat taken ? "
neutral," No , please feel free . "
neutral, Do you work in Shanghai ? 
neutral, Yes I do . How about you ? 
neutral," No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . "
neutral, You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? 
neutral," Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! "
neutral, Uh huh ... 
neutral,"Look at this headline , Soo Mi . "
neutral, Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! 
neutral, Is it the same in Korea ? 
neutral," I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . "
neutral, Do people get married young ? 
neutral, Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . 
neutral, Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? 
neutral," No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . "
neutral, The beauty under the tree ? 
neutral, She is a young man ! 
neutral,Excuse me.Where do I register ? 
neutral," Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . "
neutral," Is that the large , white building ? "
neutral," Yeah , that's it . "
neutral,How was your education going on in Australia ? 
neutral, I'm going to graduate this summer . 
neutral," Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? "
neutral, I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
neutral, Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
neutral," Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . "
neutral," Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . "
neutral,"Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? "
neutral," Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . "
neutral, I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? 
neutral," I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . "
neutral," You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? "
neutral, Once in a while . 
neutral, It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . 
neutral, I hope I can practice self-control again . 
neutral,What ' s the plot of your new movie ? 
neutral," It ' s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ' s very little evidence . It ' s a psychological th "
neutral, Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . 
neutral, I have had disagreement with every director . I ' Ve worked with . We ' Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ' t no 
neutral, Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ' Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 
neutral, Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
neutral, Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 
neutral," I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ' t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ' ll leave that to the experts in future . "
neutral,Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? 
neutral, She's my grandma . 
neutral, She's looks very healthy.How old is she ? 
neutral, 92 . 
neutral,Mom . My legs are killing me . 
neutral, Hold on . We will be successful right away . 
neutral," Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ' ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... "
neutral,What did you say ? 
neutral, I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
neutral," Well , I feel a little tired . "
neutral," Come on ! A little labor , much health . "
neutral, Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
neutral, Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
neutral, I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 
neutral, I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . 
neutral,Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ' s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? 
neutral," Don ' t worry about it , I ' ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ' t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! "
neutral, I know ! Well ... he said I ' m not pregnant . I ' m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ' t do it on purpose ... 
neutral," Don ' t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ' t thought of you.And now that I ' m with you again , I ' m ... I ' m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ' t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? "
neutral," Just hold me ... I ' ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . "
neutral,"Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? "
neutral, As long as it doesn't take too long . 
neutral, My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . 
neutral, Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? 
neutral," He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . "
neutral, So what's the problem ? 
neutral,"Mary , how was your date with john ? "
neutral, it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
neutral," oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? "
neutral," he is tall and slim , fair-haired . "
neutral, sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
neutral, he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
neutral," oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? "
neutral," he didn't say , but he said he would call me . "
neutral, maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
neutral," oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? "
neutral," come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . "
neutral,"Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? "
neutral, What ' s up ? 
neutral," Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . "
neutral," Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? "
neutral," Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . "
neutral, This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
neutral, I am still waiting for their call . 
neutral," Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . "
neutral,So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? 
neutral," Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . "
neutral,Which pair of jeans do you like best ? 
neutral, I really like the straight legs . 
neutral, But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? 
neutral, I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . 
neutral, That's the style ! You just wear boxers . 
neutral, What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? 
neutral, You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! 
neutral," If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! "
neutral,"Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? "
neutral, Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . 
neutral, Do you have a ride home ? 
neutral," No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? "
neutral," I live downtown , with my parents . "
neutral, Do you have a car ? 
neutral,What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
neutral," I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . "
neutral,Cigarette ? 
neutral," Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? "
neutral," Sorry , here . "
neutral, Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ' m on duty . 
neutral, I ' ll stand in with you if you like . I ' Ve got nothing else to do . 
neutral," Oh , no . I couldn ' t possibly . "
neutral,"Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? "
neutral," Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . "
neutral," Well , Rose . "
neutral, Is there something any need ? 
neutral, Are your free this weekend ? 
neutral," Yes , I have nothing to do . "
neutral," Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? "
neutral, I beg your pardon ? 
neutral, I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . 
neutral, Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? 
neutral," Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . "
neutral, I'll be there on time . 
neutral,How do you shoot pool ? 
neutral," You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . "
neutral, And ? 
neutral, You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . 
neutral, How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? 
neutral," At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . "
neutral,The mosquitos are biting me ! 
neutral," Me , too , I can ' t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . "
neutral, Do you have any bug spray ? 
neutral," No , I forgot to buy some . "
neutral, Then we ' ll have to put up with it . 
neutral," We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ' ll get drunk and fall asleep . "
neutral," That ' s without a doubt , the best idea you ' Ve had ! Let ' s do it ! "
neutral, Run ! They are thirsty for more ! 
neutral,"Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? "
neutral," I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . "
neutral, Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . 
neutral," Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . "
neutral," All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . "
neutral," Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . "
neutral,"Okay , can I ask you something direct ? "
neutral, Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
neutral, Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 
neutral," No , seriously . . . I really want this . "
neutral," I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . "
neutral, I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . 
neutral, I guess so . 
neutral,My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . 
neutral, It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . 
neutral, But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? 
neutral, It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . 
neutral, What time is the right moment ? 
neutral, Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . 
neutral,"Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . "
neutral," Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . "
neutral," It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . "
neutral,Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 
neutral, I'm afraid so . 
neutral,What do you think of the coming match ? 
neutral, Winning is a piece of cake to me . 
neutral, You are bragging again . 
neutral,What would you reckon the taxing increases ? 
neutral," Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . "
neutral, But what do most people think about it ? 
neutral," Ah , it ' s hard to say . "
neutral,are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 
neutral, of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
neutral," yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . "
neutral, we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . 
neutral," that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . "
neutral, it can't be that bad . 
neutral," I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . "
neutral," do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . "
neutral," ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? "
neutral," when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . "
neutral, has anything else happened to you ? 
neutral," nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . "
neutral," well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . "
neutral,Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . 
neutral, Why doesn't he ask her ? 
neutral, He is too scared to ask her . 
neutral, He's a chicken guy . 
neutral,I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . 
neutral, Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . 
neutral," If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . "
neutral," She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? "
neutral,Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . 
neutral, Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 
neutral, John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing . 
neutral,What do you need ? 
neutral, I need to use the Internet . 
neutral," You have your library card , right ? "
neutral," Yes , I do . "
neutral, There is a wait right now to use the computers . 
neutral, That ' s fine . 
neutral, Would you please write your name on this list ? 
neutral, Then what ? 
neutral, I will call you when a computer is free . 
neutral, How do I log on to the computer ? 
neutral, Use the number on the back of your library card . 
neutral, Thanks . I ' ll be sitting over there . 
neutral,What do you make of the case ? 
neutral," If you ask me , I don ' t think it ' s guilty . "
neutral, What do you mean by saying so ? 
neutral, I mean it ' s not his fault . 
neutral," Oh , yeah ? "
neutral, Yes . Don ' t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? 
neutral,I have a real problem when I meet people . 
neutral, What is it ? Maybe I can help . 
neutral, I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? 
neutral, Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? 
neutral," Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . "
neutral," It ' s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ' t . "
neutral," But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . "
neutral," Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . "
neutral,"Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . "
neutral, Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . 
neutral," Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . "
neutral," Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . "
neutral," Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? "
neutral," The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . "
neutral," Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... "
neutral, I would think this was the least they could do . 
neutral, In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . 
neutral," I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . "
neutral,Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . 
neutral, Let's go in to wait for them . 
neutral, After you . 
neutral,When do you usually go to the movies ? 
neutral, I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? 
neutral, The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . 
neutral, That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . 
neutral,Are you telling us a lie again ? 
neutral, I will be hanged if I lying . 
neutral, All right . But what was the trouble ? 
neutral, My car run out of petrol . 
neutral,I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? 
neutral, He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . 
neutral," Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . "
neutral, When did you start worrying about your weight ? 
neutral, I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? 
neutral," No , Jess , chill out ! "
neutral,"Come on , Tara . Let ' s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . "
neutral, We can ' t break into the line . Don ' t be so impatient . We ' ll be at the front of the line soon . 
neutral," Two tickets , please . How much are they ? "
neutral," Oh no , Ari . I didn ' t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ' s go Dutch . I ' ll pay my own way . I insist . "
neutral, I ' m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ' s newspaper . 
neutral," Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ' m tired of heavy drama . "
neutral, Are these seats okay ? 
neutral," They ' re fine , but I can ' t watch a movie without popcorn . "
neutral,Do you often buy magazines ? 
neutral, I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
neutral, Why don ' t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
neutral," Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . "
neutral, Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
neutral," Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . "
neutral, Do you have a subscription ? 
neutral," Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? "
neutral, I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ' t buy any regularly . 
neutral, What are you so excited about ? 
neutral, What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . 
neutral, There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . 
neutral," No , how much is it worth ? "
neutral, part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? 
neutral," oh , it ' s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? "
neutral," sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . "
neutral," yeah , but I ' m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . "
neutral, that ' s true . I ' m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? 
neutral, of course . There ' s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . 
neutral," you mean you got working experience , right ? "
neutral, not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . 
neutral, it must be very demanding . 
neutral," sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ' s easy to figure out . "
neutral, maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ' ll show you around . 
neutral, I can't open the door . 
neutral, It must be locked . 
neutral, Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
neutral, She can't answer you . 
neutral, She must be deaf . 
neutral, Frightened ? You must be joking . 
neutral,Have you got any hobbies ? 
neutral, Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . 
neutral, Which is easier to learn ? 
neutral," Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . "
neutral,You'd better prepare for the examination . 
neutral, I don't think the exam will be very hard . 
neutral," You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . "
neutral, Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . 
neutral,It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . 
neutral," I did , but he gives me a runaround . "
neutral," If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . "
neutral, But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . 
neutral,"What is the correct time , please ? "
neutral, It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
neutral, When will the lecture begin ? 
neutral, It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . 
neutral,Should I ask Sara to the party ? 
neutral, I would if I were you . 
neutral,"If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . "
neutral, You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . 
neutral," Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . "
neutral,We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? 
neutral, What is a sixties party ? 
neutral, You come dressed in anything from the sixties . 
neutral,"I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . "
neutral," Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . "
neutral," I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . "
neutral," A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . "
neutral," Well , children usually resemble their parents . "
neutral, It ' s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
neutral, You often like comparing children with their parents . 
neutral, You ' re right . 
neutral,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? "
neutral," Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . "
neutral, I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? 
neutral, Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . 
neutral, It must be interesting to study English . 
neutral, Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
neutral, Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 
neutral, Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
neutral, What is it ? What happened ? 
neutral," I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring. He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . "
neutral, What did you do ? 
neutral," I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . "
neutral, Did he leave when you left ? 
neutral, Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
neutral, What did you do ? 
neutral, He followed me all the way home ! 
neutral, That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
neutral," Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . "
neutral, Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
neutral, I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
neutral," Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . "
neutral, Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
neutral,"Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? "
neutral," I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? "
neutral, I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . 
neutral," Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . "
neutral," But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? "
neutral," Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . "
neutral," I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? "
neutral," That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . "
neutral, Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . 
neutral, Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? 
neutral, Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . 
neutral," That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . "
neutral," So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? "
neutral," Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . "
neutral, Why did they want to found a college ? 
neutral, Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . 
neutral," Oh , I see . "
neutral," Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . "
neutral, When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? 
neutral," In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . "
neutral, It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . 
neutral," Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . "
neutral," Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . "
neutral, Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . 
neutral, I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . 
neutral, Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . 
neutral,I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 
neutral," Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . "
neutral, I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . 
neutral, But I have an appointment with Ann . 
neutral," Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . "
neutral,What do you do in summer ? 
neutral, I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? 
neutral," I don ' t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . "
neutral, What do you do in winter ? 
neutral," Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ' m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . "
neutral," I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ' s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . "
neutral, Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! 
neutral, Do you think we ' ll have a nice summer this year ? 
neutral," Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! "
neutral,"I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . "
neutral, I think you ' ll lay it to rest with the time flying . 
neutral, I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ' t want to forget . 
neutral, But I think time can change everything . 
neutral,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? "
neutral, Pardon ? 
neutral, What university would you enter ? 
neutral," Oh , I forget.Sorry . "
neutral, I went to Harvard University . 
neutral, Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
neutral," I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . "
neutral, I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? 
neutral," Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . "
neutral, Yep . And I should start planning now . 
neutral, Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? 
neutral, Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . 
neutral, How Ay days will the reunion be ? 
neutral, Usually it's at least five days and four nights . 
neutral,"Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . "
neutral," Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . "
neutral, To me English is a difficult language . 
neutral, A second language is always difficult . 
neutral," True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . "
neutral, One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
neutral, No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
neutral,What did you think of the film ? 
neutral," Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? "
neutral,What ' s up ? You don ' t look too good . 
neutral," Yeah , yeah , but today ' s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . "
neutral, It ' s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ' s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
neutral," Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ' s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ' s what the math says . "
neutral," Math , sheath . What ' s the evidence ? "
neutral," There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ' s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! "
neutral," Anyway , it ' s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ' s the scientific rigor in that ? "
neutral," Dude , don ' t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ' t you ? "
neutral,Which film shall we see ? 
neutral, Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
neutral," No , I'm not hungry . "
neutral," Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . "
neutral,Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ' m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? 
neutral," I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ' t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . "
neutral, I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . 
neutral,Can I borrow your suit ? 
neutral, That's out of the question . 
neutral,"Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? "
neutral, Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today . 
neutral, You knew Brain Locker ? 
neutral," Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? "
neutral," Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses . "
neutral," Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . "
neutral,Where are you from ? 
neutral, I'm from Guangzhou . 
neutral, Where in China is Guangzhou ? 
neutral, It's in the South of China . 
neutral,"Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . "
neutral," In that case , I won ' t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime . "
neutral," Ok , Goodbye . "
neutral, See you later . 
neutral,Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ' m in level two and I ' m loving my class this semester ! It ' s great being in a class of international students ! 
neutral," Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . "
neutral," That ' s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ' s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , "
neutral," That ' s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o "
neutral," Well , I think you ' re pretty lucky actually . You ' ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . "
neutral," I guess so , but I think it ' s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . "
neutral, Don ' t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
neutral, I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 
neutral," Well , there is that , yes . "
neutral,"Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ? "
neutral," Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now . "
neutral, That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant . 
neutral, I know one . Let's go . 
neutral,"Good morning , Miss Li . "
neutral," Morning , Mike . "
neutral, I ' m sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
neutral, I ' Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 
neutral, I feel much better now . 
neutral, Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
neutral, I ' Ve already got it . Thanks . 
neutral, I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 
neutral, I will . 
neutral, But it used to be ignored by many people . 
neutral, The bright people will remember it forever . 
neutral," Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . "
neutral,What is the weather like today ? 
neutral," It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind . "
neutral, And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
neutral, I missed today's weather for cast in the radio 
neutral," It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery . "
neutral, The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport 
neutral, That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . 
neutral,What kind of music do you like listening to ? 
neutral," I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ' t you ? "
neutral," Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . "
neutral, I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ' s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . 
neutral, Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . 
neutral, Yes . That ' s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ' m cooking or doing other housework . 
neutral, I ' Ve got a few classical music CD ' s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . 
neutral, You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . 
neutral, That ' s true . There ' s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ' s feeling and character . 
neutral,There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . 
neutral, I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . 
neutral," That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? "
neutral," No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . "
neutral, What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? 
neutral, Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . 
neutral," That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . "
neutral, Let's try it ! 
neutral," Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ' s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? "
neutral, It ' s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
neutral,"Well , I am a regular member of this club . "
neutral, Do you have to pay to join ? 
neutral," Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars . "
neutral," Very few , unfortunately . "
neutral, How was your game today ? 
neutral, Ten . How did your game go ? 
neutral, Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . 
neutral, It's at 8: 00 . 
neutral," Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late . "
neutral,Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? 
neutral," No , it's the Japanese team . "
neutral, Japanese teams always play a dark horse . 
neutral," Well , their team work is well worth learning . "
neutral,Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? 
neutral," Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . "
neutral," Okay , that's good . "
neutral, Do you want me to put in a good word for you ? 
neutral,Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . 
neutral, I know only too well what that's like . 
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral, I was very sad when I was laid off last year . 
neutral,"Hi , Is that David ? "
neutral," Hi , Jenny . It's David here . "
neutral," Hey , what's new ? "
neutral, Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . 
neutral, Sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
neutral," Well , she told me things just weren ' t working out and we weren ' t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . "
neutral," Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . "
neutral," Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? "
neutral," Ok , then . "
neutral, But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . 
neutral, What face ? 
neutral, The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . 
neutral," Yeah , I know . You are right . "
neutral," Hey , just watch out for cops or you ' re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? "
neutral," Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . "
neutral, Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . 
neutral," Cut out , would you ? "
neutral,When's your birthday ? 
neutral, It's just around the corner . 
neutral,Bob is getting on in years . 
neutral," Yeah , I'm very worried about his health . "
neutral, He looks tired all the time . 
neutral, He's working too hard . 
neutral,Which church do you attend ? 
neutral," I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . "
neutral, What ' s the difference between this and other Churches ? 
neutral," Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . "
neutral, Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? 
neutral," That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . "
neutral, Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? 
neutral, Yes . 
neutral, Why do you really go to church ? 
neutral," We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . "
neutral,Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic . 
neutral, That's okay . Better late than never . 
neutral," Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ' m shocked that the police haven ' t caught the killer yet . "
neutral, People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . 
neutral, You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
neutral, There must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ' t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . 
neutral," Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? "
neutral, Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . 
neutral," Well , they ' Ve got the money and she ' s going tomorrow for treatment . "
neutral," I ' m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ' m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ' m amazed that I haven ' t even won a small prize yet . It ' s so unfair ! "
neutral," Don ' t be moody ! I hope you ' re not tired , because we ' Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . "
neutral,Are there many idioms in English ? 
neutral, There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
neutral, Can you give us an example ? 
neutral, I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information . 
neutral, What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 
neutral," That is just a natural , grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages . "
neutral,Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? 
neutral," Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely . "
neutral," I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . "
neutral,Do you know where I can park ? 
neutral, Do you need a spot here or off campus ? 
neutral, I want a space on campus . 
neutral, There's a parking structure for students . 
neutral, Where can I find it ?

neutral, Is it full ?

neutral, Would it be full now ? 
neutral, I am really not sure . 
neutral,Have you heard of the Love Bug ? 
neutral, Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ? 
neutral," Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it . "
neutral,I am confused by what he said . 
neutral, Why do you say that ? 
neutral, I don ' t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ? 
neutral, Think a little . I think he means well at the bottom of his heart . 
neutral,Where are you going ? 
neutral, I ' m going to the hospital . 
neutral, What ' s the matter ? 
neutral, Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident . 
neutral, That ' s too bad . How are things now ? 
neutral," His life is hanging by a thread , and he is under an emergency treatment . "

neutral, Yes . Mostly to England and France . 
neutral,Where's your better half ? 
neutral, She's at home . 
neutral,"Look , there are some words on the fish . "
neutral, I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . 
neutral, Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . 
neutral," Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . "
neutral," OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? "
neutral,"Who's singing in your home , Jim ? "
neutral, It's Ellie and her friends . 
neutral, Who's Ellie ? 
neutral," She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing "" Happy Birthday "" . "
neutral," Oh , I see.how old is she ? "
neutral, She's ten . 
neutral, I suppose they're playing games . 
neutral," Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? "
neutral, Today . 
neutral,I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
neutral, And what did the program say ? 
neutral, It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . 
neutral, I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . 
neutral, And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 
neutral," And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . "
neutral,Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . 
neutral, The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . 
neutral," I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . "
neutral,What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . 
neutral, It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . 
neutral, Such a thing exists ? 
neutral," Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! "
neutral, Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . 
neutral," You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... "
neutral,Did you get any rewards or honors in college ? 
neutral, Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ? 
neutral," Yes , I joined the CPC when I was a freshman "
neutral,Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season .

neutral," Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? "
neutral, I don't have the foggiest idea . 
neutral, I thought she'd be happy . 
neutral," Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . "
neutral, I don't know . Maybe it ' s some kind of personal problem . 
neutral,I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . 
neutral," You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . "
neutral," I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . "
neutral," You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . "
neutral, Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ' t miss something interesting . 
neutral," No , you are just on time . We haven ' t really started yet . "
neutral, Don ' t bother . I will help myself . 
neutral, Make yourself at home . 
neutral,"Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? "
neutral, You look so upset . What's going on ? 
neutral," Oh , what a pity ! "
neutral, Is it that bad ? It ' s nothing more than a game . 
neutral,I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
neutral," Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . "
neutral," We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . "
neutral, The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
neutral, I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? 
neutral, What a shame ! 
neutral, That's too bad . 
neutral, Then my son drove into a tree . 
neutral, I'm sorry to hear that . 
neutral, The dog bit the delivery boy . 
neutral, What a pity ! 
neutral, And a storm blew our roof away . 
neutral," Ho , no ! "
neutral,When do you go to bed usually ? 
neutral, I go to bed at ten and get up at six . 
neutral, That's helpful for your health . 
neutral, Sure . 
neutral,Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? 
neutral," When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? "
neutral," The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . "
neutral, That's right . Why do you ask ? 
neutral, Do you like amusement parks ? 
neutral," For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . "
neutral,Can you speak French ? 
neutral," Yes , I can , but not very well . "
neutral, Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? 
neutral," More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? "
neutral," About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e "
neutral,you look better today . How did your test go ? 
neutral, much better than it did yesterday . 
neutral, did you pass ? 
neutral, you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . 
neutral, you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . 
neutral, did you always do well at school ? 
neutral," no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . "
neutral," sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? "
neutral, I'll get my finals in two months . 
neutral, when do you plan on studying for those exams ? 
neutral, most students just cram the night forehead . 
neutral, do you think that's a good idea ? 
neutral," no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . "
neutral, that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? 
neutral, I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . 
neutral, it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! 
neutral,Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? 
neutral," Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? "
neutral, I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . 
neutral, I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . 
neutral, That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . 
neutral, Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! 
neutral, Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . 
neutral, Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . 
neutral, I wanted to go to Malibu beach . 
neutral, I like Santa Monica . 
neutral, I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . 
neutral, Is Malibu beach nice ? 
neutral," It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . "
neutral,There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? 
neutral," I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ' ll happen before it ' s too late . "
neutral," We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ' s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ' s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . "
neutral," Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ' s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ' re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . "
neutral," In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . "
neutral, It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
neutral, Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . 
neutral, I think I ' d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
neutral, I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . 
neutral," Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . "
neutral, When did you change your mind ? 
neutral," After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . "
neutral, Yeah . I went to California to study . 
neutral, I was there between 88 and 90 . 
neutral, And what did you do after that ? 
neutral, Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . 
neutral, A house warming party ? 
neutral," Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . "
neutral," I understand . That ' s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . "
neutral, That ' s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . 
neutral," I agree . That ' s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . "
neutral,What can I do for you ? 
neutral, I am trying to find this book . 
neutral, What ' s the problem ? 
neutral, It doesn ' t seem like this library has it . 
neutral, Have you checked the computer ? 
neutral, I have already . 
neutral, What did it say ? 
neutral," It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ' t find it there . "
neutral, I can always borrow the book from another library . 
neutral, You can do that ? 
neutral, I ' ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . 
neutral,ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? 
neutral, I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? 
neutral," We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . "
neutral, What is the rate ? 
neutral," Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . "
neutral, How about mileage and gas ? 
neutral, There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . 
neutral,Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? 
neutral,Which film shall we see ? 
neutral, There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
neutral," No , I'm not hungry . "
neutral," Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . "
neutral,"Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? "
neutral," Yes , that's true . "
neutral, How long is the holiday ? 
neutral, It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . 
neutral, Do you eat any special food for the festival ? 
neutral," Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . "
neutral," That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? "
neutral," Yes , it's really wonderful ! "
neutral, Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . 
neutral, But a taxi costs too much . 
neutral, That's true . 
neutral,"I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . "
neutral, do you have any other symptoms ? 
neutral, I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
neutral, just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
neutral," yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . "
neutral, how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 
neutral," no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . "
neutral, how did you get that burn again ? 
neutral, I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
neutral," you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? "
neutral," no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . "
neutral, when's the last time you took your tablets ? 
neutral, I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
neutral, I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 
neutral," just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . "
neutral," sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? "
neutral, that sounds good . 
neutral," soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . "
neutral,I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . 
neutral, Why don't you find someone who is in the know . 
neutral," I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . "
neutral," Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . "
neutral,What are you two doing in here ? 
neutral," We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . "
neutral," I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . "
neutral," Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . "
neutral, All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? 
neutral, I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... 
neutral,You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? 
neutral," Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . "
neutral, With the job ? 
neutral, A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . 
neutral," It wasn't always like this , you know . "
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral," Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . "
neutral, You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . 
neutral," Certainly , perhaps . "
neutral,"Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . "
neutral," Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . "
neutral," Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . "
neutral," Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! "
neutral,"Dad , what's the date ? "
neutral, It's December eighteenth . 
neutral, In seven days it will be Christmas Day . 
neutral," Yes , I know that . "
neutral,"What happen , John ? "
neutral, Nothing . 
neutral, Why do you look unhappy ? 
neutral," Oh , cheer up . He ' ll understand you . "
neutral,"This man is your fiance , Dolly ? "
neutral," Yeah , how do you like him ? "
neutral, He's handsome . 
neutral, Can you give me a touch of his character ? 
neutral," He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . "
neutral,Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? 
neutral, Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . 
neutral,"Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? "
neutral, No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... 
neutral," It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... "
neutral, They're going to give us back the seats ? 
neutral," No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... "
neutral, You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . 
neutral,"The world changes , the family changes too . "
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral, People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . 
neutral, That is called a nuclear family . 
neutral, I don't like such a family . 
neutral, What kind of family are you like ? 
neutral," I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . "
neutral, It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . 
neutral," We can live well , I think . "
neutral,What was that all about ? 
neutral, We had a difference of opinion . 
neutral, Is she going to be okay ? 
neutral, She'll be fine . 
neutral,Is sailing fun ? 
neutral,John dates her seven times a week . 
neutral, I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . 
neutral, Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
neutral, Right . 
neutral,I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . 
neutral, I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . 
neutral, Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . 
neutral,"Good morning , Loans . "
neutral," Good morning , Mr . Smith . "
neutral,Which countries have you been to ? 
neutral," I ' Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . "
neutral, I thought you had been to Australia too . 
neutral," No , but I ' m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ' Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ' Ve been to ? "
neutral," I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . "
neutral, Isn ' t it really cold there ? 
neutral," Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ' s a wet country , so there ' s snow almost everywhere in winter . "
neutral," I ' Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . "
neutral,"Alison , would you like to have some more ? "
neutral, No thanks . I have had enough . 
neutral, Actually you haven't have much . 
neutral," To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . "
neutral, That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 
neutral," Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . "
neutral," Thank you , shall I open it now ? "
neutral," Yes , please do . "
neutral,"Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? "
neutral, No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? 
neutral, Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . 
neutral, I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . 
neutral, Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . 
neutral,"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ' re famous , so everyone loves them . "
neutral, I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . 
neutral," I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ' t it ? "
neutral, I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
neutral," No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ' t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . "
neutral," Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ' s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ' t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ' t like . "
neutral," I don ' t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ' re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . "
neutral, I think you should give them some credit . They ' re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . 
neutral,"Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? "
neutral, Cut what out I ' m not doing anything . 
neutral," Yeah , I ' ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? "
neutral, Is it very cold in winter there ? 
neutral," No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . "
neutral, Does it rain a lot in summer there ? 
neutral, Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? 
neutral," There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . "
neutral, I feel it's rather dry here . 
neutral, That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here . 
neutral, Are you from the south ? 
neutral," No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . "
neutral, I see.so this is your hometown ? 
neutral," Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ' t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . "
neutral," I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . "
neutral," That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . "
neutral," It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . "
neutral, Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . 
neutral, And the streets are covered with snow . 
neutral, Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
neutral, I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . 
neutral,What are your working hours ? 
neutral," Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . "
neutral, Much better than mine . 
neutral, What are your hours ? 
neutral," Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . "
neutral,Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? 
neutral, For What ? 
neutral," Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . "
neutral,"Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? "
neutral, I went to Yale University . 
neutral, I have a B . A . in Economics . 
neutral, Would you mind telling me how old you are ? 
neutral, I'm twenty-seven . 
neutral, And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? 
neutral," Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years . "
neutral, And what was your salary at the bank ? 
neutral, I got $ 500 a week . 
neutral,"Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? "
neutral," I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . "
neutral, Late night ? 
neutral," Yeah , I got home around two . "
neutral,"I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? "
neutral," Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . "
neutral, How did that happen ? 
neutral, A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . 
neutral, Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . 
neutral,What do you do for a living ? 
neutral, I ' m a doctor . 
neutral," Yes , I do . It ' s very interesting . What ' s your job ? "
neutral, I ' m a bus driver . 
neutral," Oh , do you enjoy it ? "
neutral," No , I don ' t really like it . It ' s boring . "
neutral," that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . "
neutral," all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say "" cheese "" . OK , got you . That's terrific . "
neutral, thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? 
neutral, no problem . 
neutral, now let's have one together . 
neutral, do you know how to set the timer ? 
neutral," let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . "
neutral," OK , let's have a try . "
neutral, cheese ... 
neutral, did it come out ? 
neutral," yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . "
neutral,"Did you watch television last night , Charles ? "
neutral," Yes , I did . "
neutral," It was a good game , wasn't it ? "
neutral," Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . "
neutral, What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . 
neutral, How did it finish ? 
neutral, It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? 
neutral, It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . 
neutral, Did your wife enjoy it ? 
neutral," No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . "
neutral,"Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? "
neutral, I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? 
neutral, Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? 
neutral," Of course , I am sure . "
neutral, You shall go easy on her . she is new here . 
neutral, Just how am I supposed to do that ? 
neutral, You shall just take it in surprise . 
neutral," I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . "
neutral," Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? "
neutral, I am not . she is no picnic . 
neutral," Well . if you think I can help , let me know . "
neutral," Thanks , Serena . "
neutral,I ' m forming a music band . 
neutral, Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
neutral," Uh ... Yeah ! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . "
neutral," Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? "
neutral," We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? "
neutral," Yes , I ' m a singer . "
neutral,I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
neutral, What time are you leaving ? 
neutral, 1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m . 
neutral, What airline and what flight ? 
neutral, Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . 
neutral,"I ' m sorry , dad . But you can ' t do that . It ' s for me to decide . "
neutral," Oh , I see . You ' Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ' re only 19 . "
neutral," I didn ' t say I ' d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . "
neutral," Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? "
neutral," I didn ' t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ' t want you to tell me what to do . I ' Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . "
neutral,"Hello , Friendship Restaurant . May I help you ? "
neutral, I'd like to book a table tonight . 
neutral," Yes , Sir . For how many people , please ? "
neutral, Eight . 
neutral, What time ? 
neutral," Eight o'clock tonight , would you please set us in a private room ? "
neutral," So sorry , we're fully booked in that room . Would you like to make reservation some other time ? "
neutral,"Hey , Zina . You're here early today . "
neutral," Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . "
neutral," Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . "
neutral, Fair enough.Keep up the good work . 
neutral," Sorry , I thought you knew . "
neutral, But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
neutral, Didn't I ? 
neutral, You know you didn't . 
neutral," Well , I'm telling you now . "
neutral," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
neutral, I didn't think you'd be interested . 
neutral," Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . "
neutral,"Hi , Bill . "
neutral," Hi , Jim . "
neutral," Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ' t seen him for two weeks . "
neutral, He ' s been sick since he came back from Italy . 
neutral," Bummer , I ' m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? "
neutral," Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . "
neutral,Where's Tom this evening ? 
neutral, He's a little sick under the weather . 
neutral, He has the flu . 
neutral, Tell him I was asking about him . 
neutral, I will . 
neutral,Maybe you should talk to the teacher . 
neutral," No , it's no use . "
neutral, You never know unless you try . 
neutral, I know . She won't change my grade . 
neutral,"well , I finished my last final today . "
neutral, do you want to attend the convocation ? 
neutral," certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? "
neutral, do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? 
neutral," oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . "
neutral, no . those you have to provide for yourself . 
neutral, what do most of the students do ? 
neutral," well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f "
neutral," then , I might as well have them made . "
neutral, hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . 
neutral, it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . 
neutral, here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? 
neutral," Certainly . Ok , got you . "
neutral,Do you mind if I ask you a question ? 
neutral," No , not at all . Go ahead . "
neutral, What do you do in order to improve your English ? 
neutral," I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . "
neutral," It ' s a good idea to have a radio , isn ' t it ? "
neutral, Sure . It ' s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ' t see the speaker ! It ' s great for improving listening comprehension . 
neutral," It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ' t it ? "
neutral, It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . 
neutral,"Good morning , Sue . "
neutral," Good morning , Tom.How are you ? "
neutral," I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? "
neutral, Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? 
neutral, I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ? 
neutral," I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run . "
neutral," See you later , alligator . "
neutral," After a while , crocodile . "
neutral,Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . 
neutral, It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
neutral, What methods do you use to conserve water ? 
neutral," Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . "
neutral, I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
neutral," Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . "
neutral," We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . "
neutral, The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ' t believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
neutral, I think you ' re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
neutral,Hurry up . Time is running out . 
neutral, I see . I have run as fast as I can . 
neutral,"Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? "
neutral," Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ' t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . "
neutral, Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
neutral, It might work . I ' ll have to hear it.Show me what you ' Ve done . 
neutral, It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
neutral," It ' s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ' t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b "
neutral, Is that better ? 
neutral," Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? "
neutral, Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
neutral,Can you tell me the time ? 
neutral, It's 5:30 by my watch . 
neutral, Is your watch right ? 
neutral, Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . 
neutral,I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . 
neutral," Are you angry , Lisa ? "
neutral, Please don't tell my mom . 
neutral,"Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? "
neutral, I wouldn't say so . 
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral," Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . "
neutral,is everything alright ? 
neutral," yes , everything is fine . "
neutral, what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! 
neutral, I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 
neutral," we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . "
neutral, then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! 
neutral," we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . "
neutral," turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? "
neutral," yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . "
neutral, so where did you land ? 
neutral, we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . 
neutral, that sounds like a nightmare ! 
neutral, it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . 
neutral, have you had anything to eat ? 
neutral, I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 
neutral, I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 
neutral,I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . 
neutral, What's that ? 
neutral," Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? "
neutral, That's the most important thing . 
neutral, It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . 
neutral, Forget about it . 
neutral," When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . "
neutral," Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . "
neutral,What date is it today ? 
neutral," Today is December 23,2002 . "
neutral," Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . "
neutral," Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . "
neutral," It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? "
neutral,"You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . "
neutral, Luckily that was nothing serious . 
neutral," But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . "
neutral, You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . 
neutral, I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . 
neutral, You said it . 
neutral, What does it say ? 
neutral," Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . "
neutral," I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . "
neutral," The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? "
neutral, These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . 
neutral,"I love slim girls , don ' t you ? "
neutral, Not particularly . I like fat girls . 
neutral," And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? "
neutral, I can ' t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . 
neutral," Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . "
neutral, Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . 
neutral," But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? "
neutral, Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . 
neutral,What's going on here ? 
neutral, Master Li ? Who's that ? 
neutral,I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? 
neutral," Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . "
neutral," I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! "
neutral, You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . 
neutral," In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . "
neutral," Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! "
neutral,What day is today ? 
neutral," It's Thursday , I think . "
neutral, Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . 
neutral," We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . "
neutral, We'll meet again in a few days . 
neutral,I decided to go for this kind of life . 
neutral, Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . 
neutral, I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 
neutral, Then you will be in line for a doom . 
neutral,What day is it today ? 
neutral, It's Friday . 
neutral,Are you new to this school ? 
neutral," Yes , I ' m new . "
neutral, Is this your first year in college ? 
neutral, I transferred from another school . 
neutral, Where did you transfer from ? 
neutral, I was at PCC before . 
neutral, Why did you transfer ? 
neutral," I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ' t good enough . "
neutral, Did you like it at PCC ? 
neutral, PCC is an incredible school . 
neutral,There is something wrong with my girlfriend . 
neutral, What's the trouble ? 
neutral, The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . 
neutral, What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? 
neutral," Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . "
neutral," Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? "
neutral,Are you ready to go to the bank ? 
neutral," Sure , what do you need to do there ? "
neutral, There ' s problem with my bank statement . There ' s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . 
neutral, I have to exchange some money . 
neutral, that ' s right . You ' re going away next week . 
neutral, I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . 
neutral," I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ' t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . "
neutral, Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ' s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . 
neutral, would you like to live in the country ? I ' m not sure I ' d like it . 
neutral," I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . "
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral," I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . "
neutral," People can ' t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ' s more to do . "
neutral, Just remember that in that village there ' s nothing to do . There ' s not even a pub or restaurant . There ' s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . 
neutral,Hey Mike . What are you doing ? 
neutral, Nothing much . What are you up to ? 
neutral, I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . 
neutral, He took the civil service exam and failed . 
neutral, That sucks . He must feel depressed . 
neutral, Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . 
neutral, Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . 
neutral,Did you hear Peter just retired ? 
neutral, He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 
neutral,We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? 
neutral, Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . 
neutral,"are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! "
neutral," I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . "
neutral," Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... "
neutral," No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . "
neutral," They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . "
neutral," I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . "
neutral,I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . 
neutral," Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? "
neutral," Nonsmoking , please . "
neutral, All right . May I have your name ? 
neutral, My surname is Gao . 
neutral," How do you spell it , sir ? "
neutral,"OK . Come back into the classroom , class . "
neutral," Does the class start again , Mam ? "
neutral," Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . "
neutral," Oh , breaktime flies . "
neutral," come on , baby . It ' s time now . "
neutral," Mam , another minute , could I ? "
neutral," Hurry up , little boy . "
neutral,"why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! "
neutral," oh , Iris , it ' s about the job with the PR company . "
neutral, it ' s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . 
neutral, but my mother won ' t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ' m afraid she will say no again . 
neutral, she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ' t be able to focus on my studys . 
neutral, that may be true . But I ' m sure you ' re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? 
neutral," I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ' m a senior now , I don ' t want to miss the chance this time . "
neutral, I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . 
neutral," I ' ll try , but what if she insists ? "
neutral," just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . "
neutral, do you think it will work ? 
neutral, sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . 
neutral,Where did you go yesterday ? 
neutral, I went to play tennis in the public park . 
neutral, How often do you play tennis ? 
neutral, Twice a week . How about you ? 
neutral, I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
neutral, What is very difficult to gather team player together . 
neutral, I usually play with my school-mates . 
neutral, Do you like watching football matches ? 
neutral, Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . 
neutral,Why are you all dressed up ? 
neutral, I've got a date . 
neutral,"I ' m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . "
neutral," Why don ' t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? "
neutral, What do you suggest ? I can ' t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 
neutral," Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . "
neutral,I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
neutral, And what did the program say ? 
neutral, It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . 
neutral, I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . 
neutral, And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 
neutral," And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . "
neutral,"Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . "
neutral, I was playing a joke on you . 
neutral," Dear , forgive me . I won ' t do that again . "
neutral,Where are you going this weekend ? 
neutral, I ' m going to Hainan . 
neutral,"Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . "
neutral," All right , Sis ! "
neutral," Come on , it's cool outside . "
neutral, I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . 
neutral," Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? "
neutral," Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . "
neutral, What ? Are you crazy ? 
neutral, I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . 
neutral," Ew , Danny , gross ! "
neutral," By the way , what's your favorite weather ? "
neutral," I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . "
neutral," Look , is that Tom ? "
neutral," Well , that's life . "
neutral,Did Roll win the race ? 
neutral," Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . "
neutral," But anyway , he won at last . "
neutral, Yeah . To win is the most important thing . 
neutral,What's this then ? 
neutral," It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . "
neutral, But this should have been handed in last Thursday . 
neutral," Well , what's your excuse then ? "
neutral, My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
neutral," Oh , Yes ? "
neutral," It's true , sir . "
neutral,"Hey , This is your order . "
neutral, Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . 
neutral, Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . 
neutral, Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? 
neutral," Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . "
neutral," Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? "
neutral," No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . "
neutral," Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . "
neutral, OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . 
neutral," Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? "
neutral, OK . But I'd like some cookies . 
neutral," Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . "
neutral," Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . "
neutral, It's OK . Thank you . 
neutral,Do you think the bad weather will last long ? 
neutral, I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . 
neutral, I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . 
neutral,Let's go in . 
neutral, After you . 
neutral,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? "
neutral, Pardon ? 
neutral, What university would you enter ? 
neutral, University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
neutral," Oh , I forget . Sorry . "
neutral, I went to Harvard University . 
neutral, Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
neutral, God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
neutral," I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . "
neutral," Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . "
neutral,I think he deserved his gold . 
neutral, Did you see his last dive ? 
neutral," Yes , it's perfect ! "
neutral, He's diving for the gold . 
neutral,"You are studying here , aren ' t you ? "
neutral, Yes . I have been here for three years . 
neutral, Do you like this campus ? 
neutral, How come ? 
neutral," Oh.It ' s awful , but it can ' t be helped . "
neutral, I ' ll just have to put up with it . 
neutral,How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! 
neutral, Don ' t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . 
neutral, I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . 
neutral,Hi Mark . 
neutral, Hi . 
neutral, What are you planning to do today ? 
neutral, I'm not sure yet . 
neutral, Is 11:30 AM OK ? 
neutral," Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? "
neutral," I said , 11:30 AM . "
neutral," Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? "
neutral,"I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . "
neutral," Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . "
neutral, I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . 
neutral, OK.See you on Today . 
neutral,Are you really dating with Frank ? 
neutral," Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ' s not very much to my liking . "
neutral, Then why not keep away from him ? 
neutral, The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . 
neutral, That ' s stupid . 
neutral,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . "
neutral, I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back . 
neutral, Where were you ? 
neutral, I was in New York for a wedding . 
neutral,What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? 
neutral," I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . "
neutral, What do you like best about it ? 
neutral, I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . 
neutral, What do you think of the ending ? 
neutral," The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . "
neutral,"Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . "
neutral, Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . 
neutral, That ' s right . 
neutral, You ' ll exert all your energy and get out of it . 
neutral,Is that your phone ? 
neutral," Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? "
neutral," Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . "
neutral," Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? "
neutral," No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . "
neutral," Yes , I guess I should try to use it . "
neutral, I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? 
neutral," Yes , if that's all right for you . "
neutral, I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . 
neutral, It doesn't matter . Forget it . 
neutral, I don't think I performed well . 
neutral,I just dropped in to say goodbye . 
neutral, What time are you leaving ? 
neutral, I'll leave at 10 o'clock . 
neutral,Come back . You haven't paid yet . 
neutral," May , just let him go . "
neutral, But he took some newspaper away without paying . 
neutral, I know . 
neutral," He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . "
neutral, Why does he have such a privilege ? 
neutral, He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . 
neutral, I see . Does he live by himself ? 
neutral," Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . "
neutral, He must be lonely ? 
neutral, I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . 
neutral, How respectable ! 
neutral,How may I help you ? 
neutral, I need to get on the Internet . 
neutral, Do you have your library card with you ? 
neutral," Yes , I have it . "
neutral, You ' re going to have to wait for a computer . 
neutral, That ' s okay . 
neutral, Please put your name on this list . 
neutral, Then what do I need to do ? 
neutral," When there is a computer available , I will call you . "
neutral, What do I do to log on to the computer ? 
neutral, Just type in the number on the back of your library card . 
neutral,Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? 
neutral," Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? "
neutral, Aug 8 . 
neutral, Mrs . White . 
neutral," Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . "
neutral, Maybe her uncle will . 
neutral," I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? "
neutral, Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . 
neutral, Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? 
neutral," Yes , Jane says they will go to China . "
neutral,Don ' t do that again . You are riding the tiger . 
neutral, No problem . I can deal with it well . 
neutral, You will ask for it . 
neutral," All is best now , isn ' t it ? "
neutral,Hurry up ! Time is money ! 
neutral, Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
neutral, But you are too slow to follow them . 
neutral, Don't you see I'm trying my best ? 
neutral,Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . 
neutral," Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . "
neutral, You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . 
neutral,"Steve , you look pale . What happened ? "
neutral, Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . 
neutral, Is there anything I can do to help you ? 
neutral," Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . "
neutral,"Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . "
neutral," Sure , When is good time for you ? "
neutral, Can you make it on Tuesday ? 
neutral, What time do you want me there ? 
neutral, Anytime after six will be fine . 
neutral," All right , It's a date . "
neutral, What's her figure ? 
neutral, What's the color of her eyes ? 
neutral, Dark blue . 
neutral,What ' s the life expectancy in your country ? 
neutral," I ' m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? "
neutral," About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ' s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . "
neutral," I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . "
neutral, Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
neutral, How ' s your son these days ? 
neutral," Oh , he ' s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . "
neutral, He ' ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? 
neutral," I had mine when I was 24 . that ' s a little young . I ' d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . "
neutral, Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 
neutral," Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ' t often succeed . "
neutral, Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 
neutral," It ' s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . "
neutral,"Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? "
neutral, You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . 
neutral, Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? 
neutral, No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . 
neutral, Did you register yet ? 
neutral, Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . 
neutral, What classes do you think are still open ? 
neutral," Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . "
neutral," I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . "
neutral, He does that ? 
neutral, I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . 
neutral,I've been so stressed these days . 
neutral, What's the matter ? Are you OK ? 
neutral," I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . "
neutral, Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . 
neutral, And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . 
neutral," You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . "
neutral," OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? "
neutral," OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . "
neutral," That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? "
neutral," En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . "
neutral, Is the training center helpful ? 
neutral, I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . 
neutral,I'm glad we live in a small town . 
neutral, Why ? 
neutral, Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . 
neutral," Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? "
neutral," Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? "
neutral, I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . 
neutral, When can you come ? 
neutral, I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . 
neutral,"You know , smoking does do harm to your health . "
neutral," Yes , you're right . "
neutral, Why don't you try to give it up ? 
neutral," I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . "
neutral, Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . 
neutral," Yes , maybe I should have another try . "
neutral,"Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? "
neutral, Why ? What was it about ? 
neutral," It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . "
neutral, A lot of young people have to do that . 
neutral," Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . "
neutral, lt sounds like the story of my life . 
neutral," Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . "
neutral, I take sleeping pills sometimes . 
neutral," Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . "
neutral, It sounds a very depressing film . 
neutral," Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , "
neutral, I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . 
neutral, Do we have enough time ? 
neutral, It's a fifteen-minute intermission . 
neutral, Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
